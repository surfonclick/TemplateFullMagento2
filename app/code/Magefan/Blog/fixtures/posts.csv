I loved creating something so beautiful for a woman who loves fashion, style and takes risks when it comes to what she wears! Along with Nicolette, I also follow Ashley Graham and Candice Huffine, who I believe are changing the game for plus-size fashion. I like to see what these cool, young girls are wearing and how they are inspiring others to take risks with what they wear and own their bodies! I think it&rsquo;s great!</p>","<p><span>Boutique festival Secret Garden went down in Sydney&rsquo;s&nbsp;Camden over the weekend, and all the free-spirited kids came out to play in a mix of creative and outlandish ensembles.

"14 Shoe Hacks That’ll Put Pep Back in Your Step",,,14-shoe-hacks-that-rsquo-ll-put-pep-back-in-your-step,,em_ads_08_2.jpg,"<p>They&rsquo;re stylish, ambitious and spectacularly connected: these Australian fashion bloggers are fit for the new-and-improved digital age. With a cult social media following and entrepreneurial empires, the days of a simple OOTD Instagram post partnered with a hashtag and&nbsp;aesthetically pleasing filter are officially gone.Yes, that&rsquo;s right. There&rsquo;s a lot more to fashion blogging than meets the eye, and, despite the luxurious vaycays, designer labels and blogger besties.</p>","<p>Pricey&nbsp;shoe&nbsp;repairs are for amateurs. We&rsquo;re no&nbsp;MacGyver, but if you give us a hair dryer, a jar of petroleum jelly and a pair of pumps, we can&nbsp;hack&nbsp;our way out of just about any shoe dilemma. And guess what? So can you. It doesn&rsquo;t take boatloads of money or hours of back-breaking tinkering, all you need is a little bit of&nbsp;ingenuity and a whole lot of patience.&nbsp;Ready to take matters into your own hands? Here are 14 super simple shoehacks&nbsp;that will blow your mind. Satisfaction guaranteed.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>To clean the&nbsp;rubber tips of your Chuck Taylors,&nbsp;make a paste out of baking soda and water. Add a dollop onto an old toothbrush and scrub-a-dub-dub.</li>
<li>When your&nbsp;shoes are a little too snug, put on a couple pairs of socks, stuff your feet into the shoes and aim a warm hair dryer at the tight areas, while you flex your feet. Continue to wear the shoes as they cool. Repeat if necessary.</li>
<li>Out of&nbsp;shoe polish? Buff dull leather with a clean cloth and a dime-size amount of lotion.</li>
<li>Prevent&nbsp;blisters&nbsp;by rubbing a stick of deodorant where your shoes are likely to rub, like at your heels and under stiff straps.</li>
<li>To remove scuff marks&nbsp;from dark patent leather, dab a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover onto the shoe. Once the mark is&nbsp;gone, wipe the area with a clean cloth. Then apply a small amount of mineral oil to maintain the shine. For light patent leather, squeeze a small amount of toothpaste onto the mark and let it sit for a few minutes. Rub the toothpaste in until the scuff disappears, wipe the area clean and apply mineral oil.</li>
<li>If your shoes smell to high heaven,&nbsp;DIY an odor eater.&nbsp;The most convenient solution is a tea bag. Place a couple inside your shoes overnight to absorb the smell. Repeat over the course of two to three nights, if needed.</li>
<li>Salt stains&nbsp;on your winter boots can be a real drag. To spiff them up, gently wipe off&nbsp;some of the residue with a mild&nbsp;liquid soap and water. Then prepare a spray bottle with equal parts water and white vinegar. Shake well. Spray the mixture on the salt stains and wipe your shoes with a clean cloth. Once the stains are gone, rub in a pinch of your favorite lotion to maintain the shine.</li>
<li>Never get tripped up by&nbsp;frayed shoelaces&nbsp;again! The next time they unravel, Scotch tape the ends. It doesn&rsquo;t get easier than that.</li>
<li>Fix squeaky shoes&nbsp;in five minutes flat. First, locate the problem area by walking around in your shoes in a quiet room. If the inside of your shoe squeaks, lift your insoles and sprinkle baby powder, cornstarch or baking powder. If it sounds like the base of your shoe is making noise, massage the powder into the outside seams. You can also swab a little bit of WD-40, soaked onto a cotton ball, around the outside seams of your shoes as long as it&rsquo;s not suede.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;waterproof your leather shoes, smear petroleum jelly onto the seams and &ldquo;bake&rdquo; the shoes in the oven for one hour at 300 degrees.</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re traveling,&nbsp;wrap the bottom of your shoes in an old shower capto&nbsp;protect your clothes.</li>
<li>If the tips of your heels wear down, most convenience stores stock&nbsp;Quick Tips&nbsp;in three sizes and two colors (nude and black). Just slip them on and forget about it.</li>
<li>How many times have you tried on your dream boots only to find out the shaft is squeezing the life out of your calves? Been there, done that. To&nbsp;stretch boot shafts, swab the inside with rubbing alcohol to loosen the leather. Then wear the boots with a couple pairs of high socks for 30 minutes. You may need to repeat the process a few times, but it&rsquo;s worth it.</li>
<li class=""hover"">If you don&rsquo;t have a&nbsp;shoe closet, make your own! Just paint and mount wall molding on your bedroom walls or in your closet. Then hang your heels on the molding to clear floor space.</li>

All you have to do is chuck these 10 style mistakes and you’ll look younger overnight. Hey, we share because we care. ",10-style-mistakes-that-are-probably-aging-you,"Looking for the fountain of youth? Skip the Eat, Pray, Love journey. All you have to do is chuck these 10 style mistakes and you’ll look younger overnight. Hey, we share because we care. ",em_ads_07_4.jpg,"<p>This year brought us trends we&rsquo;ll always treasure, like perfectly frayed hems and socks and heels. But for every chic fashion sensation, there was a trend that made us cringe. From granny chic to ridiculously overpriced athleisure, we couldn&rsquo;t escape the year&rsquo;s most ridiculous looks. And then there were styles we once loved that were worn ad nauseam this year, like the ubiquitous naked dress and street-style-baiting novelty bag. Above, find the trends we can&rsquo;t wait to leave behind in 2015.</p>","<p>Looking for the fountain of youth? Skip the Eat, Pray, Love journey. All you have to do is chuck these 10 style mistakes and you&rsquo;ll look younger overnight. Hey, we share because we care. Mistake #1: Black Overload Sure, black can be slimming, but here&rsquo;s the real deal: As we age, our skin gets thinner and the starkness of a black top against our faces will emphasize wrinkles and dark circles. So, lighten up! Mistake #2: Wearing the Wrong Bra Size Did you know that wearing the wrong bra size not only makes you look older, but it can shrink your torso and affect how every item in your wardrobe fits? Make sure you know your true bra size. It will change your life. Mistake #3: Emphasizing Your Lower Lashes Painting up your lower lashes with eyeliner and mascara only draws attention downward and overemphasizes crow&rsquo;s-feet and dark undereye circles. When you apply makeup, think of how a facelift works. Everything should be lifted up, up and away. So, skip the lower lashes and focus on your upper lashes instead. Makes sense, right? Mistake #4: Embracing Too Much Normcore Mom jeans may be back, but so are bucket hats. Take it with a grain of salt. Mistake #5: Thick, Oversized Glasses Every woman should have one statement piece or signature look they rely on. Thick glasses have a tendency to magnify fine lines and wrinkles around the face, however. To try out a different pair that will suit you better Mistake #6: Over-Applying Matte Makeup We get it: No one wants to walk around feeling like a grease ball. But if you go overboard on mattifying makeup products, you&rsquo;ll zap the moisture from your skin and lose the dewy glow of youth. Add a little bit of shine on your lips and stick with only one matte product at a time. Mistake #7: Dropping Your Hemline Just because you&rsquo;re getting older doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to cover up and join a convent. In fact, hemlines hovering at or above your ankle may make you appear frumpier, wider and yes, older. One trick to dressing your shape is finding the thinnest part of your leg and shopping for dresses and skirts that fall around that point. Mistake #8: Severe Haircuts When you&rsquo;re 17, severe haircuts are at worst emo and at best cutting edge. But as you age, severe cuts are just, well, severe. If you want to shed 10 years, soften your hairdo and schedule frequent trims to ward off dry, brittle ends. Mistake #9: Buying Jeans with Too Much Stretch When stretch jeans came out, we all thought our prayers were answered &mdash; that is, until we figured out that &ldquo;too much of a good thing&rdquo; meant &ldquo;saggy butt syndrome.&rdquo; When you&rsquo;re looking for stretch jeans, check the tag to make sure your new jeans don&rsquo;t have more than 2 percent elastic fibers. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of a butt lift for a fraction of the cost. Mistake #10: Piling on the Foundation An excess of foundation will cake in the creases of your skin and we all know how that story ends. Instead, stick with a good BB cream or a tinted moisturizer and call it a day.</p>","2015-12-24 09:51:52","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2015-12-24 00:00:00",1

These beloved figurative clips began with the artistic collaboration of Maurice Duvalet, a French-born designer who moved to America at the end of World War I, and John Rubel, the House’s manufacturer who had just emigrated from Paris. With the first examples created in the 1940s, the glittering ballerina clips depicted the feminine figure in various graceful forms and positions of classical ballet with faces represented by a rose-cut diamond. Today, the ballerina continues to take center stage in Van Cleef & Arpels contemporary repertoire of designs, including the Daphnis ballerina clip, circa 2008, featured in the exhibition.","2016-01-13 06:56:51","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-01-13 00:00:00",1

<p>First worn in the funeral scene in Rome, Bond is sporting Tom Ford Snowdon sunglasses. Handmade in Italy, the Snowdon is a classic shape made of thick acetate.&nbsp; There has been some speculation as to the color worn, however after watching the film and speaking with our Tom Ford reps, we can confirm he is wearing the glossy &ldquo;Black on Dark Tortoise&rdquo; colorway, however *NOT* with the default grey gradient lenses. He instead is wearing the frame with solid brown lenses (which does not come this way from Tom Ford).</p>
<p>So to pay tribute to the film, for a limited time we are offering a Tom Ford Snowdon custom: which is the black on dark tortoise colorway, customized with dark brown lenses. And in the true Bond spirit, the premium lenses are also polarized to eliminate any reflective glare, as we can&rsquo;t imagine him wearing anything but the best.</p>

The Kanban table’s circular top has a slightly raised edged and sits on a slender rod of bent steel. The entire piece is attached to the base by a metal band, which encircles the top of its tapered concrete base. “The concept of the table was reinvented starting from the essential components of base and top and an innovative use of materials, shape, colour and layout,” said Andrea Ponti, who founded his studio in 2012.
The designer aimed to “capture Hong Kong” in the furniture, and convey its architectural character and identity as a crossroads between east and west. The inclusion of steel and concrete is intended to reference the city’s historic industrial buildings, particularly its multi-storey factories that have been converted into offices. The shape of the table was based on the neon street signs that hang on steel bars over streets in the Kowloon district. “The contrasting colours of neutral concrete and charcoal steel give the table a minimalist pictorial quality: they create a chiaroscuro – an effect of contrasting light and shade,” added Ponti.
“The original layout of the flat horizontal top floating above the vertical cylinder base creates an unexpected shift in volumes and an exquisite contrast between density and airiness.”

He declares (on page 5) his wish for more women and older people to take up cycling, along with “more cyclists of all social backgrounds” and “more black and minority ethnic Londoners.” How might this laudable objective be achieved?

It’s plain to those who wish to see that installing segregated infrastructure is not the universal answer to this question. Though safety considerations are a major factor inhibiting a lot Londoners from travelling by bike, there are also significant, specific cultural factors at work. The mayor’s Foreword didn’t mention these, but Transport for London has made a contribution to addressing them in partnership with the environmental regeneration charity Groundwork. Grants of up to £10,000 have been awarded to 31 community organisations of different kinds to fund cycling projects seeking to embrace those groups of Londoners yet to be much seduced by the hoped-for “cycling revolution”.","2016-02-04 09:43:36","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-02-04 09:43:36",1

Thomas B Thriges Street was built in the 1960s as a solution to growing car congestion: a fast-moving, four-lane road laid like a curved ribbon across the middle of the city.

That ribbon was first trimmed 18 months ago when a central section of the street was closed to vehicles. More is to come in the next few years, as the rest of the road is transformed into a new heart for Odense, reserved for bikes and pedestrians, and lined with shops, cafes and homes.

It is the centrepiece of a hugely ambitious, and initially controversial, near-£3bn makeover for Denmark’s third-biggest city, which is attempting to revive itself from slightly struggling post-industrial area to a hi-tech hub for education and industry. And at the centre of this transformation is the thing Odense boasts it does as well as anywhere in Europe: liveability.","2016-02-04 09:44:26","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-02-04 09:44:26",1

You don&rsquo;t need to turn on the stove or the oven because this recipe requires no baking, just perfectly ripe avocados and some whole food-based ingredients. Key Lime Avocado Tart I am super excited to be sharing this recipe with you today because I have a feeling it will become a fave with your family. Speaking of family&hellip;I can&rsquo;t wait to share these tarts with baby Vienna (Note: To be clear, I do not mean this literally! When she&rsquo;s older, I can&rsquo;t wait to give it to her&hellip; as this has raw honey). She was watching me like a hawk as I was assembling the tarts. She&rsquo;s tried avocado but we&rsquo;ll have to wait a bit for this recipe. In a future post, I&rsquo;m going to write all about what I&rsquo;ve been feeding her because I have been getting asked this question a lot. She helped me assemble the crust of the tart as you can see in this photo. :) Key Lime Avocado Tart In the photo below is all the ingredients in my wonderful tarts (except the vanilla is missing). As per my usual joyous recipe-creation-style.. I&rsquo;ve made these from simple ingredients that I hope you have in your kitchen right now. If you haven&rsquo;t seen my &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in my fridge&rdquo; or &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in my freezer&rdquo; videos you&rsquo;ll get a good sense of what I stock in my kitchen on a regular basis which is why I always have these types of ingredients on hand. Key Lime Avocado Tart If the idea of using avocados in a dessert is a new concept to you, don&rsquo;t fear it! EMBRACE IT! Your taste buds and digestive system will thank you. Avocados while high in monounsaturated fat, they are very satiating so a little goes a long way. They are also a great source of fiber so you will feel totally satisfied when you have this as a dessert as opposed to your run-of-the-mill key lime tart from the grocery store. Limes and avocados make all my foodie dreams come true. The taste together is absolute perfection! Whether it&rsquo;s in guac or pudding &mdash; it&rsquo;s a match match in joyous heaven.

<p>So much has happened in the last six months that it is near impossible to summarize it all here. But you can certainly follow our adventures on instagram and Periscope! Our lives have changed dramatically &mdash; in the best way possible. There is more love in our home then I ever could imagine. And I never thought it was possible to get by on so little sleep. The sleep is getting so much better but it&rsquo;s still a work in progress. I think that I will need a solid 4 weeks of good sleeps before I don&rsquo;t have dark circles under my eyes any more haha! However in speaking to mamas with older toddlers they often tell me they still haven&rsquo;t slept&hellip; in 3 years!! Mama mia!!</p>
<p>We get her down by 6:30 or 7pm with very little fuss (that took some work) but the daytime naps are not as easy as the nighttime routine &mdash; each day is a bit easier. The toughest part for us is really sticking to a routine because running a small business together with my hubs means no two days are ever alike. Vienna seems to roll with it pretty well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in a snapshot, but I thought a fun way to do this post would be to share answers to the most common questions I&rsquo;ve been getting as a new mama on social media!

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take very long to prep at all because I didn&rsquo;t peel the apples. I recommend you don&rsquo;t peel them because most of the fiber and nutrients are contained within the peel. Plus when you blend it, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter because it will be smooth. And this is fine for babe too.</p>

<p>Apples are a source of many different nutrients including vitamins A, C, folate and choline and minerals such as potassium, calcium and phosphorus. They are a source of soluble and insoluble fiber &mdash; you need both for good digestion and detoxification. The phytonutrients in apples are very blood sugar balancing because they contain quercetin which inhibits specific enzymes that break down sugars. This translates to a slower release of sugar into the bloodstream. Additionally, the fiber in apples feeds the good bacteria in your gut! And anything you can do to take care of your gut bacteria is a good thing. Have you read my latest article about probiotics and constipation?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the apples look like when they are perfectly cooked. As you can imagine, our home smelled AMAZING!</p>","2016-03-18 04:01:25","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-03-18 00:00:00",1

<p>Bone broth has many benefits including:</p>
<p>Wonderful source of very easy-to-digest minerals including calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus<br />Fantastic source of amino acids. If your broth congeals when it&rsquo;s refrigerated you know you&rsquo;ve got lots of gelatin which contains amino acids essential for healthy bones and connective tissue like tendons and ligaments. <br />Incredible for the building and the healing of the digestive system. Bone broth helps reduce allergies by aiding in the integrity of the gut lining<br />Immune boosting and anti-inflammatory making it very healing for autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, crohn&rsquo;s and colitis<br />Simple Bone Broth</p>
<p>Now that sweet Vienna is ready for eating and drinking more than just breast milk I was super excited to introduce her to bone broth. Guess what? She LOVED it! She&rsquo;s had avocado, sweet potato, applesauce and banana and the bone broth was by far her favourite. Next up she will have some egg yolks &mdash; I&rsquo;m not going to introduce the white until much later.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s having about 2 tbsp per day of the broth because breast milk is still the main source of her nutrition.

<p>This is the perfect way to start your day. You really feel the difference starting your day with nourishing vitamins and minerals, protein and fat &ndash; that is exactly what you&rsquo;ll get in this pudding. Walker finds he gets a really clean energy from the addition of Greens+ Extra Energy. (Side note: I would totally use it too if I wasn&rsquo;t breastfeeding Vienna). However, I did sneak a spoonful and it is deeeelish!</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just in his head&hellip;</p>
<p>Greens+ is clinically proven to increase energy and vitality.<br />In fact, research out of the University of Toronto found that after a few months of daily use not only did participants find their energy levels increased but also mental well-being improved.</p>
<p>As per my usual recipe creation style, I like simple. So, if you&rsquo;re like me you might appreciate the simplicity of this recipe made with ingredients you probably have in your kitchen already.</p>

<p>Now because it is so energizing, I do not recommend this as a before-bed snack.

A few years ago, Chris and I took the Eyes Open Creative Photography E-Course and it was a real game-changer.  As I’ve shared previously, completing the e-course is what enabled us to hone our photography skills and really take Floret’s blog, website and social media posts to the next level.

Erin Little is the talented photographer and blogger, who created the course.  She has a great eye for capturing everyday life in such beautiful, creative and compelling ways. The approachable style and flexible format of Erin’s e-course made it possible for me to finally understand all of the photography terms that I previously found so intimidating and confusing.

<p>I learned it the hard way. &nbsp;In the early years, I was&nbsp;pretty sloppy with our&nbsp;tools. &nbsp;I would grab whatever was closest to harvest flowers, trim stems, and snip wires. I ruined a lot of expensive clippers in the process. &nbsp;And I also almost ruined my hands. &nbsp;I was young and felt invincible, but after hours of repetitive work, day in and day out, carpel tunnel slowly started to creep in. &nbsp;The pain was a real wake up call and I knew I had to make some serious changes in how I operated.</p>
<p>The experience definitely made me appreciate the fact that my hands are one of the most&nbsp;important tools for farming, designing, writing, and well, just about everything I do, so keeping them safe and healthy is essential. &nbsp; I now have some pretty strict rules about what cutting tools are used&nbsp;for each&nbsp;job. No more shortcuts. &nbsp;No more cutting chicken wire with my floral snips. No more oversized, heavy clippers for harvesting. &nbsp;No more excuses.</p>
<p>Here are my top seven&nbsp;tools I use on a regular basis to cut, snip, chop, prune and lop:&nbsp;<span>Wire cutters: &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicken wire is essential to most of my floral designs&ndash;I use it almost exclusively to support the stems of my flowers&nbsp;and give the designs&nbsp;a more natural look. &nbsp;I also use standard floral wire for boutonnieres and a few other floral design elements. Cutting all that&nbsp;wire can be quite a job&mdash;a job for a good pair of wire cutters! &nbsp;Flower snips are, as their name suggests, great for clipping&nbsp;flowers. &nbsp;They are NOT, however, made for cutting wire. &nbsp;Sure,&nbsp;a great pair&nbsp;</span><em>can</em><span>&nbsp;do it. &nbsp;But they really&nbsp;</span><em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em><span>&nbsp;do it. &nbsp;And trust me when I tell you: &nbsp;just&nbsp;</span><em>don&rsquo;t</em><span>&nbsp;do it. &nbsp;Using flower snips to cut wire is a surefire way to &ndash;at best&ndash;dull your blade&ndash;or at worst, bust it. &nbsp;Save your hands and your tools from a lot of stress by investing in a good pair (or two) of good wire cutters. &nbsp;I use large, industrial-strength wire cutters&nbsp;for chicken wire and smaller wire cutters for boutonniere work.</span></p>","2016-05-18 09:02:25","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-05-18 00:00:00",1

<p>One thing's for sure: Using Android N on a device you carry all day is a very different experience from using it on a secondary screen. For better and for worse, it gives you a whole different perspective on the state of the software and its real-world user experience.</p>
<p>Let's start with the good, shall we? In this third pre-release incarnation, Android N is (for the most part) impressively smooth and snappy. Most of the time, I don't even think about the fact that I'm using a beta version of a still-in-progress OS update.</p>

<p>Android N feels immediately familiar, which is generally a good thing. Sweeping visual changes should be a rare occurrence with an operating system -- more the exception than the rule -- and Google is absolutely not trying to reinvent the wheel this go-round. If you're used to Marshmallow, you'll feel comfortable from the get-go with N; in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it took some casual users a fair amount of time to even notice what's different.</p>
<p>The differences are definitely there, though -- and once you clue into them, some of them can actually be pretty significant in day-to-day use. Android N's refined notifications, for instance, have become a real highlight for me and something I miss when I go back to a 6.0-level device. Google has taken a good thing and made it better, with clusters of individual cards now being grouped together by app and easily expandable.</p>","2016-06-10 07:33:19","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-06-10 00:00:00",1

Its presence in the operating system allows developers to implement fingerprint security into their apps without much work and in a way that functions seamlessly across devices.</p>
<p>Seven months after Marshmallow's release, though, the number of apps actually taking advantage of that function is surprisingly limited. Even Google-developed apps that'd be obvious fits for fingerprint support have yet to get on board -- like Google Wallet, which requires a PIN upon startup, and Google Authenticator, which certainly should provide a security prompt when opened.</p>
<p>Then there's Android 6.0's custom text selection feature, which gives developers the ability to have an action from their app appear in a menu whenever a user selects text -- alongside basic text selection commands like copy, paste, and so forth. The idea is that such a setup could let you select text and then quickly perform a specific function with it, like translating the words into another language or looking something up in Wikipedia.</p>","2016-06-10 07:35:31","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-06-10 07:35:31",1

So disappointing as it may be, the shift we've been seeing with Motorola under its wings isn't entirely surprising.</p>","<p>In hindsight, it all makes sense. No amount of optimism or wishful thinking could change the fact that Google and Lenovo have drastically different goals and business interests. Google wants to create the best possible experience for your smartphone so you'll spend more time using it -- and thus more time using Google services and the Internet at large, which ultimately helps the company makes money. So of course Google is going to focus more on long-term ""delight"" and user experience over short-term profit from hardware sales (which has never been Google's main game).</p>
<p>Lenovo, though? Like most manufacturers, it makes its revenue by selling physical products. So disappointing as it may be, the shift we've been seeing with Motorola under its wings isn't entirely surprising.</p>
<p>Still, Moto's fall from grace means there's a spot open at the head of the class. And I now feel confident in saying that HTC is ready to step up and claim it.</p>
<p>HTC's been moving in the right direction for a while now, with an impressive and ever-improving focus on overall user experience and post-sales support. It's been climbing higher every year on my Android upgrade report card and this year came in with stronger scores than ever -- an 86% overall, following only Google's Nexus devices in terms of all-around upgrade reliability. (For perspective, LG scored a 71% while Motorola and Samsung were firmly in failing territory.) HTC may earn its profits from hardware sales like everyone else, but where it differs is that it actually seems to place value on positive long-term relationships with the people who buy its devices.</p>","2016-06-10 07:37:06","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-06-10 00:00:00",1

<p>Or so I thought. Turns out there's a simpler way: Just touch your finger to the ""?123"" key and then slide it upward across the keyboard. You'll see a screen full of numbers and special characters instantly appear, and all you have to do is swipe your finger to the one you want. Once you let go, that character will be inserted into your text, and the keyboard will go back to its regular QWERTY panel.</p>","2016-06-10 07:38:28","2016-10-26 10:50:17","2016-06-10 07:38:28",1
